# Assistants for Semantic Kernel

This enables the usage of assistants for the Semantic Kernel without relying on OpenAI Assistant APIs.
It runs locally planners and plugins for the assistants.

It provides different scenarios for the usage of assistants such as:
- **Assistant with Semantic Kernel plugins**
- **Multi-Assistant conversation**

## About Semantic Kernel

**Semantic Kernel (SK)** is a lightweight SDK enabling integration of AI Large
Language Models (LLMs) with conventional programming languages. The SK
extensible programming model combines natural language **semantic functions**,
traditional code **native functions**, and **embeddings-based memory** unlocking
new potential and adding value to applications with AI.

Semantic Kernel incorporates cutting-edge design patterns from the latest in AI
research. This enables developers to augment their applications with advanced
capabilities, such as prompt engineering, prompt chaining, retrieval-augmented
generation, contextual and long-term vectorized memory, embeddings,
summarization, zero or few-shot learning, semantic indexing, recursive
reasoning, intelligent planning, and access to external knowledge stores and
proprietary data.
