## Auto-Gen assistant

This sample is based on the approach proposed by Auto-Gen.
It is realized through 2 assistants working together to code and execute the code needed to respond to user requests.

- __AssistantAgent (NL 2 Code)__: this agent takes charge of the user's request and produces Python code to respond to the user's request.
- __CodeInterpreter__: This agent takes as input the various parameters required to execute the Python code supplied by the AssistantAgent. Through its native plugin, it interacts with Docker to start a container, install the necessary dependencies and execute the Python code in this container, then returns the result.

## Samples

With this code, you can start by requesting some actions.

### Settings

To run this sample, you will need to set your settings: 

**appsettings.development.json**: 
```json
{
  "AzureOpenAIEndpoint": "<Your Azure OpenAI endpoint>",
  "AzureOpenAIAPIKey": "<Your Azure OpenAI Key>",
  "OllamaEndpoint": "http://localhost:11434",
  "AzureOpenAIGPT4DeploymentName": "gpt-4-1106-preview",
  "AzureOpenAIGPT35DeploymentName": "gpt-35-turbo-16k",
  "CodeInterpreter": {
    "DockerEndpoint": "npipe://./pipe/docker_engine",
    "DockerImage": "python:3-alpine",
    "OutputFilePath": "C:\\auto-gen\\outputs"
  }
}
```

#### Read an provide calculations about the file

```
**User** > Given file vgsales.csv, which region has performed the best in terms of sales? What are results of each regions?
**AutoGen** > The sales results for each region are as follows:
- North America: 4392.95 million
- Europe: 2434.13 million
- Japan: 1291.02 million
- Other: 797.75 million
- Global: 8920.44 million

The region with the highest sales is Global with 8920.44 million.
```

To give this results, the autogen realized those actions:

#### Plot charts from the file content

You can also ask the copilot to plot some charts: 

```
From the vgsales.csv file, plot a chart showing the distribution of sales by region.
```

Once the code is fully executed, the assitant will open the default image viewer with the requested chat like this:
